# ❤️ Personality Traits

- **Traits:**  
“I always scan for threats and allies the moment I arrive — people are dangerous, animals are honest.”
“I don’t understand sarcasm, and I assume everyone agrees with my sense of natural order.”
“Each day begins with silent meditation in the branches of the tallest tree I can find.”
- **Ideals:**  
“Balance above all. Nature must be protected from excess — especially the kind humanoids bring.”
“I would gladly give my life to preserve the ancient rhythms of the wild.”
“The world is out of tune. Magic, growth, decay — all must flow in harmony again.”
- **Bonds:**
“My home lies in the deep forests of the North — I still hear the trees call me by name.”
“A druid once taught me that magic is part of nature’s rhythm — not a tool to be measured and caged.”
“I swore an oath to my Circle: stop the Romans from enslaving magic, or die trying.”
“I carry the grief of forests burned and devoured — and the promise that not one more tree will fall without consequence.”
- **Flaws:**  
“I see humanoids as parasites — I struggle to value their lives, even when they mean well.”
“I’m so devoted to balance that I will let people die if their survival would tip the scales.”
“I follow my oath blindly — even if it means betraying allies or destroying magical knowledge to keep it free.”
“I can’t imagine being wrong about nature, and I don’t take guidance well from anyone who walks on stone.”

# 🎭 Character Appearance

> Kamiron is a small, wiry Aarakocra with sleek bronze feathers and fierce amber eyes. His plumage is streaked with dark umber and glints of gold, giving him the illusion of a polished imperial emblem. Perched atop a Roman standard, Kamiron curls his wings and lowers his head like a statue, passing as the golden eagle of conquest. His movements are silent and exact, trained through years of aerial meditation. Robes of bark-dyed leather and forest moss trail from his shoulders like ritual vestments. Beneath him, an unseen servant — invisible but robed — carries the standard forward, giving the illusion of a divine presence leading the legion.

We are back in the city after excited hell and are once again in a city.

Turns out that Neela is a changeling.

We are regrouping at an inn/Barn; After having a long fight. 
After leaving Lost alone with Pharx - Kamiron flies back to the barn to collect the group.
Gather the group, and go outside of the city towards lost.

There was a powerfull magic item that distracted us a bit.
when meeting up with Lost again, we introduce Valeria, who turns out to be a few creature as well; 
We capture a deer for Phrax and then go and rest for the night. 
Veleria tells that the people where he comes from are called " the untamed "  and what his profession was to talk rich people out of their money and then distribute that amongst the poor.
He got in trouble with a group with the chord; 

In the forest we set up camp; and sorena reads the evil tombe to gather more spells; 
in the middle of the night a small girl approaches;
